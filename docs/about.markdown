I am an unprofessional programmer who is interested in 3D computer graphics. I have some experiences in Unity, C# and shader programming, but not "experienced". I'd like to share my progress when I successfully implemented something or learned a new tech. If you found something helpful in my blog, that's my pleasure.

This is a simple website built using Github Pages and Jekyll as my personal website and blog, you can find my email below as a form of contact.
